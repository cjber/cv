\begin{cvlist}{Education}

\item[2019 - present] \normalsize\textit{PhD Data Analytics and Society}: \textbf{University of Liverpool}

    \begin{quote}
        \small \textit{Improving the Geolocation of Emergency Service Response through Big Data}
    \end{quote}

    \small Advanced NLP with spaCy, stanza python packages. Keras implemented neural networks, pretrained models and end to end pipelines.

\item[2018 - 2019] \normalsize\textit{MSc Geographic Data Science} (Distinction, 82\%): \textbf{University of Liverpool}

    \begin{quote}
        \small\textbf{Key Modules: }\textit{Geographic Data Science, Social Survey Analysis, Database and Information Systems, Web Mapping and Analysis}
    \end{quote}

    \small I utilised advanced techniques for geospatial data analysis in both R and Python, as well as worked with the relational database management system MySQL during this degree. All assessments as part of this degree were awarded a distinction.

        \textbf{Dissertation:} \textit{\href{https://github.com/cjber/dissertation/blob/master/201374125.pdf}{Utilising Supervised Parametric Classification to Assess the Quality of the UK Rural Road Network using Aerial LiDAR Data.}} (85\%)
    \item[2014 - 2017] \normalsize\textit{BSc (Hons) Coastal Marine Biology} (First-Class, 74\%): \textbf{University of Hull}

    \begin{quote}
        \small \textbf{Key Modules:} \textit{Independent Research Project, Geographic Information Systems, Environmental Impact Assessment}
    \end{quote}

    \small While this degree had a primary focus on coastal marine ecology it allowed me to develop a keen interest in statistical analysis, in particular through the use of the R software. I utilised R heavily in my undergraduate dissertation for which I received the prize for ‘Best Dissertation’ in my department.

\end{cvlist}

\begin{cvlist}{Employment}

    \item[2018] \normalsize\textit{Graduate Ecologist}: \textbf{TEP - The Environment Partnership}

    \small Daily tasks involved interacting with clients both over the phone and in person on site, preparing quotations for new ecological work and subsequently managing jobs that were accepted by clients. I worked with the ArcGIS software package to produce maps for professional use.

\end{cvlist}


\begin{cvlist}{Aditional Interests}
\item[]

\small I am interested in using R Markdown and \LaTeX\ to produce well formatted assessments for University and have produced an R Package containing various templates, hosted on my personal GitHub page. I am also passionate about contributing towards the open source programs I use and aim to assist as much as I can.
